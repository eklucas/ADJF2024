# Advanced Data Journalism, J7432/4432
 
Welcome to Advanced Data Journalism for Fall 2024. This repository will eventually hold all the scripts we work through in class as well as additional resources for your learning (many of which you can also find in Canvas). 

Each class period I will commit the code that we work through to the [scripts](/scripts/) folder; you will also find relevant datasets in the [data](/data) folder. 

The [tipsheets](/tipsheets) folder has the following resources: 
-   Tidyverse Cheatsheets: 
	- data-import.pdf
	- data-transformation.pdf
	- data-visualization.pdf
	- lubridate.pdf
	- purrr.pdf
	- strings.pdf
	- tidy.pdf
-   [R-Functions](/tipsheets/R-Functions.html): a guide to the basic R functions that will be most useful to you in analyzing data (consider this a good list of functions you should master by the end of the semester)
-   [R-dictionary](/tipsheets/R-dictionary.html): a list of vocabularly that we will use over and over again to refer to various features of the R language
-   [Newsroom Math Crib Sheet.pdf](/tipsheets/Newsroom\ Math\ Crib\ Sheet.pdf)
