# Advanced Data Journalism, J7432/4432
 
Welcome to Advanced Data Journalism for Fall 2024. This repository will eventually hold all the scripts we work through in class as well as additional resources for your learning (many of which you can also find in Canvas). 

Each class period I will commit the code that we work through:
-   [Aug 26: weather events analysis](https://eklucas.github.io/ADJF2024/scripts/weather-event-analysis.html)
